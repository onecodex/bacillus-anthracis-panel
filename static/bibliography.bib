  abstract = "Anthrax is a fatal disease caused by strains of Bacillus
              anthracis. Members of this monophyletic species are non motile
              and are all characterized by the presence of four prophages and a
              nonsense mutation in the plcR regulator gene. Here we report the
              complete genome sequence of a Bacillus strain isolated from a
              chimpanzee that had died with clinical symptoms of anthrax.
              Unlike classic B. anthracis, this strain was motile and lacked
              the four prohages and the nonsense mutation. Four replicons were
              identified, a chromosome and three plasmids. Comparative genome
              analysis revealed that the chromosome resembles those of non-B.
              anthracis members of the Bacillus cereus group, whereas two
              plasmids were identical to the anthrax virulence plasmids pXO1
              and pXO2. The function of the newly discovered third plasmid with
              a length of 14 kbp is unknown. A detailed comparison of genomic
              loci encoding key features confirmed a higher similarity to B.
              thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27 and B. cereus E33L
              than to B. anthracis strains. For the first time we describe the
              sequence of an anthrax causing bacterium possessing both anthrax
              plasmids that apparently does not belong to the monophyletic
              group of all so far known B. anthracis strains and that differs
              in important diagnostic features. The data suggest that this
              bacterium has evolved from a B. cereus strain independently from
              the classic B. anthracis strains and established a B. anthracis
              lifestyle. Therefore we suggest to designate this isolate as ``B.
              cereus variety (var.) anthracis''.",

              city-wide scale. We sequenced DNA from surfaces across the entire
              New York City (NYC) subway system, the Gowanus Canal, and public
              parks. Nearly half of the DNA (48\%) does not match any known

              archaeal, and eukaryotic taxa, which were enriched for harmless
              genera associated with skin (e.g., Acinetobacter). Predicted
              ancestry of human DNA left on subway surfaces can recapitulate
              U.S. Census demographic data, and bacterial signatures can reveal
              a station's history, such as marine-associated bacteria in a
              hurricane-flooded station. Some evidence of pathogens was found

              suggests that the pathogens represent a normal, urban microbiome.
